Deploying this Quick Start for a new https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/{partner-company-name}-standard-infrastructure/[{vpc-name} (ASI)] with *default parameters* builds the following _{partner-product-name}_ environment in the AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=640]

As shown in this figure, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones
* In the public subnets:
** A NAT gateway
** A bastion host that enables secure access to Crowd Data Center without exposing it to the internet (for more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/linux-bastion/architecture.html#bastion-hosts[Bastion Hosts]). You can choose not to provision a Bastion host if you prefer to access {partner-product-name-short} nodes through the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html[AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager].
* An Application Load Balancer, which works both as a load balancer and a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) termination reverse proxy.
* In the private subnets:
** A {partner-product-name-short} Auto Scaling group, installed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. The instances are based on Amazon Linux and use an Atlassian-provided Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
** Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to store artifacts like attachments, avatars, icons, import/export files, and plugins in a common location that is accessible to all Crowd nodes.
** Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL in a Multi-AZ configuration, which mitigates failover in the event the master node fails.
* Amazon CloudWatch for basic monitoring of all application and database nodes in your deployment. By default, CloudWatch also collects and stores logs from each monitored node. Amazon CloudWatch is also an optional component.

=== Auto Scaling Groups in this Quick Start

This Quick Start uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html[Auto Scaling groups], but only to statically control the number of its nodes. We don't recommend that you use Auto Scaling to dynamically scale the size of your cluster. Adding an application node to the cluster usually takes more than 20 minutes, which isn't fast enough to address sudden load spikes.

If you can identify any periods of high and low load, you can schedule the application node cluster to scale accordingly. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/schedule_time.html[Scheduled Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling].

To study trends in your organization's load, you'll need to monitor the performance of your deployment.
